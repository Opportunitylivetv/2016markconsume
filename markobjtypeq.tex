This approach, put forward by Torvald Riegel in response to
Linus Torvalds's spirited criticisms of the current C11 and C++11
wording, introduces a new \co{value_dep_preserving} type qualifier.
Objects marked with this type qualifier carry dependencies.

Again, the changes to the examples from
Section~\ref{sec:Representative Use Cases}
are similar to those shown in
Section~\ref{sec:Object Modifier}.
