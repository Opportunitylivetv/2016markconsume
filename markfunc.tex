Functions containing dependency chains could be marked with
an attribute (for example, something like
\co{[[function_carries_dependencies]]}) or
a keyword (for example, something like
\co{_FunctionCarriesDependencies}).

Proper use of this approach eliminates issues with dependencies passing
through dependency-unaware code: Simply mark the relevant functions.
However, although there are many software-engineering reasons for
preferring small functions, the fact remains that large functions
are not uncommon in production code.
Large marked functions of course result in similar dependency-chain-tracing
complexity as would unmarked code, so any full proposal for this approach
should describe how this tracing will be handled.
