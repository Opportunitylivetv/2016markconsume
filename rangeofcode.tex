Ranges of code could be marked by pragmas, through use of C preprocessor
symbols, or via other ad-hoc means.
However, again, software-engineering considerations would likely cause
many such projects to mark all the translation units, which would of course
result in the same dependency-chain-tracing complexity as would unmarked
dependency chains.
Any full proposal for this approach should therefore describe how this
issue will be handled.
