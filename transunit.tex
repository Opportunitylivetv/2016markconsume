Within the language, translation-unit marking could be accomplished by
a pragma or by a language feature that changed the way pointers are
implemented.
A compiler command-line argument could also be used, but this is of
course outside the standard.
It would be desirable for marked translation units to be able to
be linked with unmarked translation units.

This approach could be useful in cases where only a few of the translation
units contain dependency chains.
However, software-engineering considerations would likely cause many such
projects to mark all the translation units, which would of course result
in the same dependency-chain-tracing complexity as would unmarked
dependency chains.
Any full proposal for this approach should therefore describe how this
issue will be handled.
