This approach, suggested by Clark Nelson, generalizes the
\co{[[carries_dependency]]} attribute specified in the C++11 standard
so that it applies to objects, including variables, formal parameters,
return values, and class members.
This paper further modifies this proposed attribute so as to also restrict
it to pointer-like objects.

There have been some objections to attributes on the grounds that
attributes are not supposed to change program semantics, but no
consensus as to whether or not this objection is substantive.

The changes to the examples from
Section~\ref{sec:Representative Use Cases}
are similar to those shown in
Section~\ref{sec:Object Modifier}.
