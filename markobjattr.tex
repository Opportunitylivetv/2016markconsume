This approach, suggested by Clark Nelson, generalizes the
\co{[[carries_dependency]]} attribute specified in the C++11 standard
so that it applies to objects, including variables, formal parameters,
return values, and class members.
This paper further modifies this proposed attribute so as to also restrict
it to pointer-like objects.
