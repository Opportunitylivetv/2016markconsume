This approach, suggested off-list by JF Bastien, creates a
\co{depending_ptr}\footnote{
	Arbitrarily chosen name with no Google hits.}
template to which a pointer-like type is passed.
This approach allows implementers considerable freedom, as they can
hook into the \co{->} and \co{*} if need be, and also use the C++
\co{delete} keyword to prohibit problematic operations.

This approach would need to be augmented with a non-template solution
for C, for example, the object-modifier approach from
the previous section.
